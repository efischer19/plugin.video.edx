# plugin.video.edx
Hackathon project June 2016

## Things to do for this hackathon project to be release to the public:
- talk to product team for approval/determine support status
- get Molly's help with licensing concerns
- determine whether to keep this in my repo, or move to an edx one
- figure out i18n usage, get that hooked up
  - still unsure whether this would go under the edx org, or the one kodi has for addons
- register a real Oauth key with main edx.org site
- (optional) get the API to return videos at multiple bitrates
    - then add a setting to say "use highest available"
- update logos to not be my cat's stupid face
