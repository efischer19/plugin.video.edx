Thing to do for this hackathon project:
    -authenticate to edX

    -get course structure per course, scrape videos
    -be able to play videos
    -write some unit tests
    -look into i18n support
        -have addon strings flagged, but transifex stuff likely not implmeneted here
        -unsure if this will be through kodi addons project, or edx
    -licensing concerns/publish
        -post-hackathon work for sure
        -answer the "edx supported product" vs "personal project" question
