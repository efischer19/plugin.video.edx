Things to do for this hackathon project:
    Xauthenticate to edX
    Xget course listing for user
    -convert courses into directory structure, with videos at leaf nodes
        -add option for context menu "course details" view as well
    -be able to play videos
    -write some unit tests
    -look into i18n support
        -have addon strings flagged, but transifex stuff likely not implmeneted here
        -unsure if this will be through kodi addons project, or edx
    -licensing concerns/publish
        -post-hackathon work for sure
        -answer the "edx supported product" vs "personal project" question
        -talk to product, OS for input
